# Pacman

I created this when I was playing around Canvas a while back. The idea came to me during a class in college.

Usage:
The user can control pacman with the arrow keys and collect all orange dots while avoiding the ghosts.

The ghosts move through a pre-determined route rather than following pacman, but they start moving faster and faster with time, making the game more difficult.

There is also a cherry that appears ramdomly in the map. Eating the cherry grants pacman a power that allows him to eat the ghosts.

The game is over if a ghost comes into contact with pacman.

You win the game if all the orange dots are collected.

Build with:
Javascript canvas
